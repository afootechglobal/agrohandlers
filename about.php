<p>About Us
Agrohandlers.com is an online marketplace for retail and bulk Nigerian food items and groceries. Operating from Lagos, we source our stocks from the most quality-reliable places all across Nigeria. Our
warehouses and distribution hubs are located in major bulk markets in Lagos, giving us the advantage of being able to deliver to our online customers at cheaper prices. Our delivery efficiency in Lagos, USA, Canada and the UK is highly facilitated by our parent company,
valuehandlers.com , a leading logistics company with over 12 years experience in distribution and logistics in Nigeria, Europe, America and Asia. At both local and the Diaspora level, Agrohandlers deliver wholesale and retail orders at the most
competitive prices. Our intent is to make our stocks available to individuals, homes and businesses at the most moderate and affordable prices. It is for this reason we go extra miles to source from the best
locations across Nigeria. We buy from most consistent, reliable and hygienically tested suppliers and with the support of our highly experienced logistics partner (www.valuehandlers.com) we deliver to our
customers in Lagos and overseas buyers professionally.</p>

<p>The cost advantage gained from our efficient buying and delivery logistics is transferred to our
customers who get their orders delivered without stress and at cheaper prices.</p>
